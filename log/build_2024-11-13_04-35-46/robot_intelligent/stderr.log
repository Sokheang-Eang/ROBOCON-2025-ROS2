[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrobot_base.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "robot_base", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robot_base" with
  any of the following names:

    robot_baseConfig.cmake
    robot_base-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_base" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "robot_base_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "robot_base" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
